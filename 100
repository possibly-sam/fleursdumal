"Ah! would that I had spawned a whole knot of vipers<br>Rather than to have fed this derisive object!<br>Accursed be the night of ephemeral joy<br>When my belly conceived this, my expiation!<br></p><p>Since of all women You have chosen me<br>To be repugnant to my sorry spouse,<br>And since I cannot cast this misshapen monster<br>Into the flames, like an old love letter,<br></p><p>I shall spew the hatred with which you crush me down<br>On the cursed instrument of your malevolence,<br>And twist so hard this wretched tree<br>That it cannot put forth its pestilential buds!"<br></p><p>Thus she gulps down the froth of her hatred, <br>And not understanding the eternal designs, <br>Herself prepares deep down in Gehenna <br>The pyre reserved for a mother's crimes.<br></p><p>However, protected by an unseen Angel, <br>The outcast child is enrapt by the sun, <br>And in all that he eats, in everything he drinks, <br>He finds sweet ambrosia and rubiate nectar.<br></p><p>He cavorts with the wind, converses with the clouds, <br>And singing, transported, goes the way of the cross; <br>And the Angel who follows him on pilgrimage <br>Weeps to see him as carefree as a bird.<br></p><p>All those whom he would love watch him with fear, <br>Or, emboldened by his tranquility, <br>Emulously attempt to wring a groan from him <br>And test on him their inhumanity.<br></p><p>With the bread and the wine intended for his mouth <br>They mix ashes and foul spittle, <br>And, hypocrites, cast away what he touches <br>And feel guilty if they have trod in his footprints.<br></p><p>His wife goes about the market-places <br>Crying: "Since he finds me fair enough to adore, <br>I shall imitate the idols of old, <br>And like them I want to be regilded;<br></p><p>I shall get drunk with spikenard, incense, myrrh,<br>And with genuflections, viands and wine,<br>To see if laughingly I can usurp<br>In an admiring heart the homage due to God!<br></p><p>And when I tire of these impious jokes, <br>I shall lay upon him my strong, my dainty hand; <br>And my nails, like harpies' talons, <br>Will cut a path straight to his heart.<br></p><p>That heart which flutters like a fledgling bird <br>I'll tear, all bloody, from his breast, <br>And scornfully I'll throw it in the dust <br>To sate the hunger of my favorite hound!"<br></p><p>To Heav'n, where his eye sees a radiant throne, <br>Piously, the Poet, serene, raises his arms, <br>And the dazzling brightness of his illumined mind <br>Hides from his sight the raging mob:<br></p><p>&mdash; "Praise be to You, O God, who send us suffering<br>As a divine remedy for our impurities<br>And as the best and the purest essence<br>To prepare the strong for holy ecstasies!<br></p><p>I know that you reserve a place for the Poet <br>Within the blessed ranks of the holy Legions, <br>And that you invite him to the eternal feast <br>Of the Thrones, the Virtues, and the Dominations.<br></p><p>I know that suffering is the sole nobility <br>Which earth and hell shall never mar, <br>And that to weave my mystic crown, <br>You must tax every age and every universe.<br></p><p>But the lost jewels of ancient Palmyra,<br>The unfound metals, the pearls of the sea,<br>Set by Your own hand, would not be adequate<br>For that diadem of dazzling splendor,<br></p><p>For that crown will be made of nothing but pure light <br>Drawn from the holy source of primal rays, <br>Whereof our mortal eyes, in their fullest brightness, <br>Are no more than tarnished, mournful mirrors!"<br></p><p>&mdash;

"Since fair enough he finds me to adore, <br>The part of ancient idols I will play <br>And gild myself with coats of molten ore.<br></p><p>I will get drunk on incense, myrrh, and nard, <br>On genuflexions, meat, and beady wine, <br>Out of his crazed and wondering regard, <br>I'll laugh to steal prerogatives divine.<br></p><p>When by such impious farces bored at length, <br>I'll place my frail strong hand on him, and start, <br>With nails like those of harpies in their strength, <br>To plough myself a pathway to his heart.<br></p><p>Like a young bird that trembles palpitating, <br>I'll wrench his heart, all crimson, from his chest, <br>And to my favourite beast, his hunger sating, <br>Will fling it in the gutter with a jest."<br></p><p>Skyward, to where he sees a Throne blaze splendid,<br>The pious Poet lifts his arms on high, <br>And the vast lightnings of his soul extended <br>Blot out the crowds and tumults from his eye.<br></p><p>"Bless&egrave;d be You, O God, who give us pain, <br>As cure for our impurity and wrong &mdash; <br>Essence that primes the stalwart to sustain <br>Seraphic raptures that were else too strong.<br></p><p>I know that for the Poet You've a post, <br>Where the blest Legions take their ranks and stations, <br>Invited to the revels with the host <br>Of Virtues, Powers, and Thrones, and Dominations<br></p><p>That grief's the sole nobility, I know it, <br>Where neither Earth nor Hell can make attacks, <br>And that, to deck my mystic crown of poet, <br>All times and universes paid their tax.<br></p><p>But all the gems from old Palmyra lost, <br>The ores unmixed, the pearls of the abyss, <br>Set by Your hand, could not suffice the cost <br>Of such a blazing diadem as this.<br></p><p>Because it will be only made of light, <br>Drawn from the hearth of the essential rays, <br>To which our mortal eyes, when burning bright, <br>Are but the tarnished mirrors that they glaze."<br></p><p>&mdash; Roy Campbell, <i>Poems of Baudelaire</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1952)<br></p><br><p><b>The Blessing</b></p><p>When, by a decree of the sovereign powers,<br>The Poet comes into this bored world,<br>His mother, terrified and full of blasphemy,<br>Clenches her fists toward God, who has pity on her:<br></p><p>"Ah, why didn't I litter a nest of vipers,<br>Rather than give birth to this mockery?<br>A curse on that night with its fleeting pleasures<br>When my womb conceived my expiation!<br></p><p>Since you chose me from among all women<br>To be the disgust of my disappointed husband,<br>And since I cannot throw back into the fire<br>This weak monster, like a love letter,<br></p><p>I will make your hate which stifles me gush forth<br>On the accursed instrument of your plottings,<br>And I will twist this wretched tree so far<br>That its blighted buds will not grow!"<br></p><p>Thus she swallows the foam of her hate,<br>And, without understanding the eternal designs,<br>She prepares in the pit of Hell<br>The pyres consecrated to the crimes of a mother.<br></p><p>Meanwhile, under the invisible care of an Angel,<br>The disinherited Child is intoxicated with sunlight,<br>And in all he drinks and in all he eats<br>Discovers ambrosia and vermillion nectar.<br></p><p>He plays with the wind, talks with the cloud,<br>And singing revels in the way of the cross;<br>And the Spirit following him in his pilgrimage<br>Weeps at seeing him happy as a bird in the forest.<br></p><p>All those he would love look at him with fear,<br>Or, emboldened by his calm manner,<br>Vie with one another in drawing from him a complaint<br>And practice on him the experiments of their cruelty.<br></p><p>In the bread and wine destined for his mouth<br>They mingle ashes with filthy spittings;<br>Hypocritically they throw away what he touches,<br>And blame themselves for stepping where he stepped.<br></p><p>His wife cries in the public places:<br>"Since he finds me beautiful enough to worship,<br>I will take on the profession of ancient idols,<br>And like them I will cover my body with gold;<br></p><p>And I will get drunk on nard, incense, myrrh,<br>Genuflections, meats and wines,<br>To learn if I can from an admiring heart<br>Laughingly usurp the homage of the gods!<br></p><p>And, when I am bored with these impious farces,<br>I will lay on him my frail and strong hand;<br>And my nails, like the nails of harpies,<br>Will dig a path to his heart.<br></p><p>Like a very young bird trembling and palpitating<br>I will pull that red heart out from his breast,<br>And, in order to satiate my favorite beast,<br>Scornfully I will throw it to him on the ground!"<br></p><p>Toward Heaven, where his eyes see a shining throne,<br>The serene Poet raises his reverent arms,<br>And the vast visions of his lucid mind<br>Shut off from him the sight of cruel races:<br></p><p>"Be blessed, my Lord, who give suffering<br>As a divine remedy for our impurities<br>And as the best and the purest essence<br>Which prepares the strong for holy ecstasies!<br></p><p>I know that you keep a place for the Poet<br>In the blessed ranks of the holy legions,<br>And that you invite him to the eternal feast<br>Of Thrones, Virtues and Dominations.<br></p><p>I know that suffering is the one nobility<br>Where the earth and hell will have no effect,<br>And that in order to weave my mystic crown<br>All times and all worlds must be used.<br></p><p>But the lost jewels of ancient Palmyra,<br>The unknown metals, the pearls of the sea,<br>Mounted by your hand, could not suffice<br>For this handsome diadem shining and clear;<br></p><p>For it will be made only of pure light,<br>Drawn from the holy hearth of primal rays,<br>And to which mortal eyes, in their full splendor,<br>Are but tarnished and sad mirrors!"<br></p><p>&mdash; Wallace Fowlie, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (New York: Dover Publications, 1964)<br></p><br><p><b>Benediction</b><br></p><p>When by decree of the almighty powers, <br>The Poet walks the world's wearisome sod, <br>His mother, blasphemous and fearful, cowers, <br>Clenching her fist against a pitying God:<br></p><p>&mdash; &quot;Ah, would whole knots of vipers were my spawn <br>Rather than this woeful abomination! <br>Cursed be the sweet swift night and evil dawn <br>Wherein my womb conceived my expiation!<br></p><p>Since of all women Thou hast chosen me <br>To be my sorry husband's shame of shames, <br>Since I may not toss this monstrosity <br>Like an old billet-doux into the flames,<br></p><p>Thy heavy hatred I shall vomit back <br>On the damned tool of your malevolence, <br>Twisting this wretched tree until it crack, <br>Never to sprout in buds of pestilence!&quot; <br></p><p>Thus she gulps down the froth of her despair, <br>Nor knowing the eternal paradigms, <br>Sinks deep into Gehenna to prepare, <br>Herself, the pyre set for a mother's crimes. <br></p><p>Yet guarded by an unseen Angel's favors, <br>The outcast child is fired by radiant suns, <br>In all he eats and all he drinks he savors <br>Ambrosial gifts and nectared benisons, <br></p><p>He sports with winds, he talks with clouds, he keeps <br>Singing along the road to Calvary, <br>While the bright Angel in his traces weeps, <br>Beholding him as free as birds are free.<br></p><p>All those whom he would love watch him with fear, <br>Or else, made bold by his serenity, <br>Wring groans from him that float sweet on the ear <br>Making him touchstone of their cruelty.<br></p><p>With his due bread and wine, hypocrites, they, <br>Mix ashes and fat gobs of spittle; grim, <br>What he has touched, these humbugs cast away, <br>Deeming it guilty but to follow him.<br></p><p>His wife cries in the market place: &quot;Behold <br>Since he adores me, I am fair, and fain, <br>As idols did, and images of old, <br>To be regilded and adored again.<br></p><p>I shall be drunk with spikenard, incense, myrrh,<br>With genuflections, viands and wine to see<br>If, as a glad usurper, I may stir<br>His heart to pay God's homages to me!<br></p><p>Tired of these impious japes and of their butt,<br>My strong lithe hand's caress with subtle art<br>And my sharp nails like harpy claws shall cut<br>A mortal path straight to his quivering heart.<br></p><p>That heart which flutters like a fledgling bird, <br>I shall tear, bleeding, from his breast, to pitch <br>It blandly in the dust without a word <br>To slake the hunger of my favorite bitch.&quot;<br></p><p>To Heaven where he spies a splendent throne, <br>Serene, the Poet lifts rapt arms;

at the worst<br>'Twere better than this runt that whines and snivels there!<br>Oh, curs&egrave;d be that night of pleasure, thrice accurst<br>My womb, that has conceived and nourished my despair!<br></p><p>"Since, of all mortal women, it would seem my fate<br>To be my saddened husband's horror and disgust;<br>And since I may not toss this monster in the grate &mdash; <br>Like any crumpled letter, reeking of stale lust &mdash; <br></p><p>"Upon his helpless form, whereby Thou humblest me,<br>I shall divert Thy hatred in one raging flood;<br>And I shall twist so well this miserable tree<br>That it shall not put forth one pestilential bud!"<br></p><p>Thus did she foam with anger, railing, swallowing froth;

<br>Spittle is in his wine. Where his footprints are seen <br>They hesitate to set their shoes, mincing beneath <br>Hypocrisy; all things he touched, they call unclean.<br></p><p>His wife in public places cries, "Since after all<br>He loves me so, that he's the laughingstock of men,<br>I'll make a business of it, be an idol, call<br>For gold, to have myself regilded now and then!<br></p><p>"And some day, when I'm drunk with frankincense, rich food, <br>Flattery, genuflexions, spikenard, beady wine, <br>I'll get from him (while laughing in his face, I could!) <br>That homage he has kept, so far, for things divine.<br></p><p>"And, when my pleasure in these impious farces fails, <br>My dainty, terrible hands shall tear his breast apart, <br>And these long nails of mine, so like to harpies' nails, <br>Shall dig till they have dug a tunnel to his heart.<br></p><p>"Then, like a young bird, caught and fluttering to be freed, <br>('Twill make a tasty morsel for my favorite hound) <br>I'll wrench his heart out, warm and bleeding &mdash;

<br>His lucid essence flames with lightnings &mdash; veiled by fire <br>Is all the furious world, all the lewd conflict there.<br></p><p>"Be praised, Almighty God, that givest to faulty me <br>This suffering, to purge my spirit of its sin, <br>To fortify my puny strength, to bid me see <br>Pure Faith, and what voluptuous blisses dwell therein.<br></p><p>"I know that in those ranks on ranks of happy blest <br>The Poet shall have some place among Thy Seraphim; <br>And that Thou wilt at length to the eternal feast <br>Of Virtues, Thrones and Dominations, summon him.<br></p><p>"I know, Pain is the one nobility we have <br>Which not the hungry ground nor hell shall ever gnaw;

Edna St. Vincent Millay, <i>Flowers of Evil</i> (NY: Harper and Brothers, 1936)<br></p><br><p><b>The Blessing</b></p><p>When, by a decree of the sovereign power,<br>The poet makes his appearance in a bored world,<br>With fists clenched at the horror, his outraged mother<br>Calls on a pitying God, at whom these curses are hurled:<br></p><p>"Why was I not made to litter a brood of vipers<br>Rather than conceive this human mockery?<br>My curses on that night whose ephemeral pleasures<br>Filled my womb with this avenging treachery!<br></p><p>Since I must be chosen among all women that are<br>To bear the lifetime's grudge of a sullen husband,<br>And since I cannot get rid of this caricature,<br>&mdash;

Two editions of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> were published in Baudelaire's lifetime &mdash; one in 1857 and an expanded edition in 1861. "Scraps" and censored poems were collected in <i>Les &Eacute;paves</i> in 1866. After Baudelaire died the following year, a "definitive" edition appeared in 1868.
